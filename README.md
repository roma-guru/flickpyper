# Flickpyper
This is Python fork of flickpaper (https://github.com/atongen/flickpaper).
Initially this was an exercise to compare Ruby and Python syntaxes.
Then wider platform support was added, but Linux/Gnome setup with one monitor
is mostly tested by me (I'm working on notebook).
Maybe better support for multiple monitors will be added later.

## Supported OS
- Linux (Gnome, KDE, Lxde, Xfce, i3/openbox)
- Windows (7,8,10)
- Mac OS X

## Requirements
__Python 3.6__ - I love that Ruby-like strings formatting!

## Install
git clone https://github.com/roman-voropaev/flickpyper
pip3 install ./flickpyper --user

## Known bugs
Windows version won't support non-ascii in your home dir!

## TODO
add to pypi
multiple monitors
